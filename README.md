## Contributing

Please report any issues or suggestions.

### Building
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.
3. Install the [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) CLI globally if you haven't already with `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
4. Run `npm install` on the project folder.
5. Run `gulp build` to build the project.

Running `gulp` will build the project and run it in a watch state. Making any changes to files will automatically rebuild the project. Install the [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) chrome browser extension and the page will reload when the project rebuilds.

### Release Process
Don't manually edit the `release` branch. Only merge `master` into the `release` branch to update it.
- Test it. (TODO: add a general test process).
- Switch to `master` branch.
- Add a description of the release in `readme.txt` & `ChangeLog.md`.
- Update all version numbers including the _Stable Tag_.
- Update WP _tested up to_ in both places: readme.txt and php.
- Recompile with `gulp build`.
- Commit with the version number in the commit note: `updating to vX.X.X`.
- Switch to the `release` branch.
- Merge `master` into `release` with `git merge master`. Use `git mergetool` to delete (`d`) _"modified"_ files that the `release` does not need.
- Commit the merge. note: `merge with master at vX.X.X`.
- Push everything to github.
- Test it one final time.
- Create a new github release at [Code > Releases > Draft New](https://github.com/mukhortov/HESH-WordPress-Plugin/releases/new): `vX.X.X @ Target:release`, Add relevant release notes from `ChangeLog.md`.
- Close the github issues related to the release with a comment linking to the release page: _Fixed in [vX.X.X](https://github.com/mukhortov/HESH-WordPress-Plugin/releases/tag/vX.X.X)!_
- [Publish to the WP Plugin Repo through SVN](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-to-use-subversion/#editing-existing-files):
	- Copy and paste the new version files from the git repo to the SVN repo `/trunk` (TODO: better way?).
	- Run `svn stat` and/or `svn diff` on the SVN repo and make sure the changes look correct.
	- Run `svn ci -m "committing version X.X.X to trunk"`.
	- Run `svn cp trunk tags/X.X.X` to make a tagged copy in the tags folder.
	- Run `svn ci -m "tagging version X.X.X"` and release the new version to the world.
	- Check to make sure WP updates the plugin.
	- Cheers! have a drink.
- Over the next 1-2weeks, watch the [plugin support page](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/html-editor-syntax-highlighter) to see if there are major bugs or if everyone hates something.


## Sample Text for testing
Paste this code in the editor to test out all the different syntax highlighting features.

```HTML
<div>
	[shortcode attribute="value" standAloneAttribute bool=true int=42 ]
		[oneliner noquotes=stringvaluewithnospaces]
		[self-closing-syntax html='<label class="name">Label</label>' /]
		shortcode content 
		<a href="#">nested html</a>
		[[escapedshortcode]]
		[ [brackets that-dont-count]]
	[/shortcode]
</div>

	a really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really long line that should wrap and indent properly

<!--more WordPress More Tag Text --><!--noteaser--><!--nextpage-->
<!--HTML comment--><!--[shortcode]-->

<div style=" width:200px; height:400px; ">styled div</div>
<style>
	/* css comment */
	#identifier, .class{
		width:200px;
		height:400px;
	}
	/* square brackets in css block */
	element[attribute="value"]{ color:red; }
</style>

<input onclick=" document.getElementById('identifier').style.width = '200px'; "/>
<script>
	// javascript comment
	var obj = {
		key: value,
		keytwo: valuetwo,
		array: ['valueone', 'valuetwo'] // square brackets in javascript block
	};
	document.getElementById('identifier').style.width = '200px';
	var string = '</script' + '>'; // writing this straight out will break the mix
</script>

ERRORS!
[/matchlessEndTag]<div class="right after error"></div>
